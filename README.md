Continuous Threat Exposure Management Maturity Model (CTEMMM)

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **CTEM Maturity Model (CTEMMM)** — a structured framework to help organizations assess, develop, and optimize their Continuous Threat Exposure Management programs.

CTEMMM provides a practical way to measure exposure management maturity across five key lifecycle phases: Scoping, Discovery, Prioritization, Validation, and Mobilization. The model was developed in response to the growing need for continuous, threat-informed, and risk-aligned exposure management programs that go beyond traditional vulnerability management.

## 📌 What Is CTEM?

**Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)** is a proactive security strategy that integrates discovery, prioritization, validation, and action across exposures in real time. CTEM helps organizations:

- Continuously discover and assess risks across internal, external, and third-party environments
- Align priorities to business impact, threat actor behavior, and attack paths
- Validate exposure mitigation using red teaming, breach simulations, and control testing
- Mobilize response workflows aligned to governance, remediation, and risk acceptance

## 🧭 How to Use the CTEMMM

1. **Review the Domains and Levels**  
   Explore the `CTEMMM.xlsx` to understand the maturity model structure across the five lifecycle phases and 40+ domains.

2. **Use the Companion Guide**  
   Refer to `CTEM Maturity Model Companion Guide.docx` for two-paragraph descriptions of each domain—ideal for stakeholder alignment and assessor training.

3. **Map Your Maturity**  
   Perform a self-assessment by scoring each domain from Level 1 to 5. Use the guidance and examples to calibrate interpretations.

4. **Apply Use Cases**  
   Use `Examples and Use Cases for the CTEMMM` to see what CTEM maturity looks like in real scenarios—useful for validation, training, and internal comms.

5. **Prioritize by Classification**  
   Focus on **Foundational** domains first, then build toward **Enhanced** and **Strategic** areas over time.
